Voltz CSCE693 Homework 1 Notes

- Server is single-process (not using threads...) (want it to do as little work as possible)
        - server should send info to client and then wait for another connection/request 
                - method to establish connection
                - method to handle commands 
                
        - the server should have the information to display to the user 
                - user session (randomly generated)
                - server time (?)
                - 
                
        - interrupts 
                - include a timeout for request...(send again?)
                
- Files that don't get edited 
        - server_main.cpp
        - client_main.cpp 
        - Server.cpp 
        - Client.cpp 
        - associated header files



Can you add storage -or- ram to a laptop



CODE THOUGHTS:

// Method to interpret user commands and perform an action on the client side (?)
// Returns Command Number to the server for processing. 
// If 10 invalid commands are executed without a valid command, disconnects the user. 
int decision(int connctionNum)
{
        //std::string usrCommand = null;
        int success = 0;
        int commandNumber = 0;
        // get the user choice 
        std::cout << "Hello, Please enter your choice"
        
        
        
        
        
        std::cout << "MENU:" << std::endl << "1: ???" << std::endl << "2: ???" << std::endl << "3: ???" << std::endl << "4: ???" << std::endl << "5: ???" << std::endl << "passwd: Change your password" << std::endl << "exit: Disconnect from server" << std::endl << "menu: Displays this menu" << std::endl;
        
        else
        {
                std::cout << "Invalid command" << std::endl;
        }
